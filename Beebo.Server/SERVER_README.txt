NOTICE: Beebo.Server.exe IS NOT USABLE IN ITS CURRENT STATE

You should only use Beebo.Server.exe if you want to launch Beebo with the -dedServer argument,
otherwise if you start the game with just the arguments directly, it will start an invisible process that you won't have any control over.
(to be fixed)

If people can still connect to the server after closing it, make sure that Beebo isn't running in the background.
